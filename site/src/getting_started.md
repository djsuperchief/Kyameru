# Getting started with Kyameru

Currently, although there is a version on NuGet, it has not been updated for a long time. The current plan is that when both the S3 and SQS components are created, the framework will be pushed to NuGet (as a beta) for general use.
Once there are enough components (not a full compliment) to make it worth while, the framework will come out of beta as V1.

For now, keep an eye on this page and the repository on GitHub.
